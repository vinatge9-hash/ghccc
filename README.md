# Aurum Atelier – Phase 2: Brand-Aligned Website Assets

This directory contains Phase 2 deliverables: a complete, responsive, image-heavy website built with Tailwind CSS, following the Noir & Gold Minimal Luxe branding for Aurum Atelier.

What you’ll find:
- index.html: Home with full-bleed hero, portfolio preview, about, services, and contact sections.
- about.html: About page with parallax/background imagery and glassmorphic content blocks.
- portfolio.html: Dedicated portfolio layout with masonry-like grid and hover reveals.
- services.html: Image-backed service cards with hover overlays and descriptive copy.
- README.md: This file.

Key design notes:
- Palette: Black, White, Gold accents (#D4AF37 / #CBA135) with subtle grays.
- Typography: Serif headings (approximate premium feel) with sans-serif body text. Font loading handled via Tailwind CDN + system fallbacks for fast render.
- Layout: Glassmorphism cards, generous whitespace, responsive grid systems, and consistent navigation.
- Animations: Scroll reveals on load, gentle hover effects, and subtle parallax on hero/about sections.
- Accessibility: Alt text for all images; semantic HTML structure; accessible color contrast.

How to run:
- Open any of the HTML files in a browser. The site is responsive and image-heavy for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Optional: host on a static site host (GitHub Pages,Netlify) for easy deployment.

Notes:
- Images are placeholder tokens (https://pixabay.com/get/gf7b1ac0f57c64a7aeeca7582d578ca0f4509c96dd21a24e3b3ecd4843000139802d42acb0f8cf88679ed0cdf3c23b0cc_640.jpg). Replace with your assets as needed.
- The loading screen demonstrates an architectural-line/logo style animation on page load.
